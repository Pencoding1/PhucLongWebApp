## What I have learnt:
First, I've learnt HTML very very serious. I learnt it before but I didn't dive deep into it and actually create any website.
Second, CSS and Bootstrap. Actually, I know a bit of CSS, all I used in my website was Bootstrap, kinda shame but for the requirement of time and deadline, it left me no choice.
Third, I've learn some JS, it isn't difference from another script language so I don't really put must effort on learning it. Like, I actually didn't learn it when I was doing the project but I know it.
Last, I know litter bit of Flask.
